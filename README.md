# EweSentiment

We acquired and preprocessed a document-level Ewe sentiment dataset called "EweSentiment" for this study. Authors collected the raw text from various 
social medai platforms including Instagram, WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Linked-In, and Twitter (via: https://forms.gle/F5jiarHFtUhpkE2F8).
The dataset consist of 5 different sentiments such as Annoyed, Surprise, Happy, Sad and Angry.

NOTE: 
Five (5) Ghanaian Ewe instructors review and examine the newly produced EweSentiment in order to determine how well it represents the precise sentiment 
class and addresses the issue with sentiment analysis in the Ewe language.
